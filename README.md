# stats_CentralLimitTheorem_RandomVariableDistribution

Calculus based Probability and Statistics for Engineers and Scientists. 
In this lab, I explore the Central Limit Theorem and random variable generation. I use functions of random variables to generate various
distributions from a Uniform[0, 1] which is the standard output of random number generators.
